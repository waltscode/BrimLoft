## Step-by-Step Project Guide for Hat Store App

### Phase 1: Project Initialization

Team Setup
- Assign roles based on interest and skill level: Frontend, Backend, Database, Testing, Documentation.
- Set up regular meetings for progress updates and troubleshooting.

Project Setup
- Install Node.js and MySQL if not already installed.
- Initialize a Node.js project (npm init).
- Create a GitHub repository and ensure all team members have access.

Dependency Installation
- Install Express.js, Sequelize, MySQL2, express-handlebars, and express-session via npm.

### Phase 2: Database Design and Setup

Schema Design
- Design a simple database schema for the store (Products, Users, Orders).
- Discuss fields and relationships as a team.

Sequelize Integration
- Initialize Sequelize and connect it to the MySQL database.
- Create models based on schema.

### Phase 3: API Development

Basic Server Setup
- Create a basic Express server.
- Set up routes for handling GET and POST requests.

API Endpoints
- Develop API endpoints for user registration, product management, and order processing.
- Test these endpoints using Insomnia.

### Phase 4: Frontend Development with Handlebars

1. Setting Up Handlebars
  - Installation: Install express-handlebars via npm (npm install express-handlebars).
  - Configuration: Set up Handlebars as our view engine in our Express.js application.
  - Directory Structure: Create a views directory for the Handlebars templates and a layouts directory for main layout files.

2. Creating Layouts and Views
  - Main Layout: Create a main layout file (main.handlebars) in the layouts folder. This file should include common elements like the header, footer, and navigation bar.
  - Page Templates:
  - Create individual Handlebars files (.handlebars) for each page (e.g., home, product page, cart, login).
  - Use Handlebars syntax ({{}}) to dynamically insert data.

3. Styling and Responsive Design
  - CSS Frameworks: Consider using a CSS framework like Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS for styling and responsiveness.
  - Custom CSS: Write custom CSS for specific styling needs. Organize the CSS into separate files for maintainability.
  - Media Queries: Use media queries to ensure your website is responsive on different devices.

4. Implementing User Interactions
- Forms: Implement forms for user input, like registration, login, and adding products.
- Event Listeners: Use JavaScript to add event listeners for user actions (clicks, form submissions, etc).
- Dynamic Content: Update parts of your page dynamically based on user interaction using JavaScript and Handlebars.

5. Frontend JavaScript
  - Functionality: Write JavaScript functions for client-side logic, such as form validation or handling shopping cart operations.
  - AJAX: Use AJAX for making asynchronous requests to your server for tasks like checking username availability or updating a shopping cart without reloading the page.

6. User Feedback and Validation
  - Validation: Implement client-side validation for forms.
  - User Messages: Display success, error, or information messages to users based on their interactions (e.g., "Item added to cart").

7. Testing Frontend Components
  - Manual Testing: Test all user interactions manually across different browsers and devices.
  - Automated Testing: Consider using frontend testing frameworks to automate testing of your UI components.

8. Optimization and Best Practices
  - Performance: Optimize image sizes, minify CSS and JavaScript files.
  - SEO Best Practices: Ensure that your HTML structure is SEO-friendly.
  - Accessibility: Make sure the website is accessible, including proper use of ARIA tags and ensuring keyboard navigability.

9. Integrating with Backend
  - API Calls: Make API calls to the Node.js backend for data retrieval and manipulation.
  - Data Rendering: Use the retrieved data to render on the frontend dynamically.

### Phase 5: Authentication

Implementing Authentication

- Set up user authentication using express-session.
- Ensure secure login and session management.

Security Measures
- Use environment variables for sensitive information like database credentials.

### Phase 6: Incorporation of New Technology

Research and Selection
- As a team, choose a new technology (library, package, etc.) to learn and implement.
- This could be a new CSS framework, a JavaScript library, etc.

Implementation
- Integrate this new technology into project in a meaningful way.

### Phase 7: MVC Structure and Code Quality

File Structure
- Organize the project files according to
  the MVC (Model-View-Controller) paradigm. This involves creating separate directories for models (data), 
  views (user interface),and controllers (business logic).

Maintaining Code Quality
- Follow best practices for coding: consistent naming conventions, proper indentation, and clear, concise comments.
- Regularly review each other's code for quality assurance.

### Phase 8: Testing

Developing Tests
- Write tests for your API endpoints and critical functionalities.
- Use testing Jest framework for backend testing.

Conducting Tests
- Perform unit tests to ensure individual components work as expected.
- Conduct integration tests to ensure different parts of the application work together seamlessly.

### Phase 9: Deployment

Preparing for Deployment
- Ensure that all environment variables are set up in  Heroku deployment environment.
- Check that the application connects to the production database.

Heroku Deployment
- Deploy the application on Heroku.
- Test the deployed application thoroughly.

### Phase 10: Documentation

Writing the README
- Draft a professional README for the GitHub repository. It should include:
- Project name and description.
- Technologies used.
- Setup and installation instructions.
- Screenshots of the application.
- Link to the deployed application.
- etc.
- Documenting the Code
- Ensure that all code files have appropriate comments explaining the functionality.


### Phase 11: Post-Deployment and Maintenance

Monitoring and Feedback
- After deployment, monitor the application for any issues.
- Gather feedback from users and note down any bugs or suggestions for improvements.
- Iterative Improvements

Plan for future iterations based on feedback.
Regularly update and maintain the application to ensure it stays functional and relevant.
